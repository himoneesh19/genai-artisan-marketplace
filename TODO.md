# TODO: Fix Generated Image Display Issue

## Completed Steps
- [x] Analyzed the codebase to understand image generation and display logic
- [x] Identified that generate_image was returning a hardcoded URL "/static/images/filename" which may not be correct
- [x] Modified generate_image in utils/ai_helper.py to return filename instead of URL and raise exception on error
- [x] Updated app.py to use url_for('static', filename=f'images/{generated}') to generate correct static URL
- [x] Added error handling to flash error message if image generation fails

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the application by generating an image and verifying it displays in preview and dashboard
- [ ] If issue persists, check browser console for 404 errors on image URL
- [ ] Ensure static files are served correctly by Flask
- [ ] Verify that generated images are saved to static/images/ directory
